It can be accessed via <code>CTRL + J</code>. Commands will not run unless a zoo is loaded.</p> <p>Console limitations to consider as of EMU v1.0.0-alpha.5:  </p> <ul> <li>The console is only visible in windowed mode and will not be accessible if you are full screen.  </li> <li>Safety checks are not yet implemented so be careful to stray too far from the expected input.  </li> <li>Console stays ontop of the main game window (in windowed mode) and will stay ontop of other windows if game is minized. If it's obtrusive, close the console with <code>exit</code>.  </li> <li>This API makes use of multi-threading to run EMU and the console simultaneously with the game. On slower hardware you might see propagation of resources take longer between what you see in the game and what you see in a function return value. For example: <code>num-tiredguests</code> might say 10, but the game says 11 for a few milliseconds longer. </li> <li><code>list-privatedonations</code> has different values than what the game displays. The array is accurate down to the second that the month changes, but then the game adds an unknown value to the final recorded value on-screen.
