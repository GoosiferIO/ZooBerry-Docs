# EMU | Extensible Modding Utility

## A Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection API Utility for Modders

Zoo Tycoon initially offered limited modding tools, leading modders to heavily depend on the game's INI configuration for modifications. This project aims to enhance modding accessibility by introducing embedded Lua scripting and expanded access to game resources that were previously unavailable.

## Compatibility

This API requires the Zoo Tycoon Complete Collection, including both expansions, and a Windows XP or newer operating system with the Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Redistributable installed.

If you do not own the Complete Collection but own the base game and have the two expansions installed, that should work as well.

## Build from Source

The .sln file has been included for the option to build from source. This requires Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 in order to compile. Express Edition should be fine.

## Installation

Drop the res-EMU.dll binary directly into your `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon` game directory.
