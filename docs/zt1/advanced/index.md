# Advanced Zoo Tycoon 1 Modding

The Zoo Tycoon 1 modding scene has been around for over 20 years and for the most part has been reliant on editing the existing configuration files to create new content. It has its own challenges of course, but recently there is a novel way to mod the game that I'd like to introduce you to: scripting. There is also the advent of users leveraging 3D modeling software to render new sprites for the game that look similar to the original game's art style. Though we will start with scripting, we will eventually cover these other methods in future tutorials.

The tutorials in this section involve more advanced concepts and techniques such as programming, scripting, and 3D modeling. At this point, you should have a good understanding of the game's configuration files and how to use a text editor to modify them. As long as you have that knowledge and are willing to learn, you should be able to follow along with these tutorials despite their advanced difficulty.

If you have any questions or need help with any of the tutorials in this section, feel free to ask for help in the [OpenZT Discord server](https://discord.gg/KcpedmghWm).
