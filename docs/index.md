# Welcome to ZooBerry Docs

ZooBerry Docs is a reference and tutorial site for Zoo Tycoon 1 modders. Our site offers detailed information on game configuration files and modding tutorials.

Although we only have reference pages for Zoo Tycoon 1 modders, we are always interested in expanding into Zoo Tycoon 2 as well. If you have tutorials or reference guides to contribute, please feel free to submit a pull request at [https://github.com/GoosiferIO/ZooBerry-Docs](https://github.com/GoosiferIO/ZooBerry-Docs) or shoot us a message on Discord.
