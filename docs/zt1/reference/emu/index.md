<h3 align="center"> A Zoo Tycoon 1 Scripting API for Modders</h3>

Vanilla Zoo Tycoon 1 has over a 20 year history of modding but users have only been able to modify the game through editing of INI configuration files. This project enhances modding capabilities by giving modders Lua scripting support so that they can create more complex and interesting mods.
