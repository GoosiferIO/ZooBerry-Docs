| 63040 | Purchase a fancy burger stand.  Guests will become hungry if they spend much time in the zoo. The burger stand can only sell to a few guests at a time, but it will relieve more hunger than hot dogs. |
| 63041 | Purchase a fancy drink stand.  Guests will become thirsty if they spend much time in the zoo. Only a moderate number of people can buy drinks at a time, but the sodas will quench more thirst than a can of soda from a vending machine. |
| 63042 | Purchase a fancy hot dog stand. Hot dogs aren't as filling as hamburgers, but they will still keep guests from being hungry. Only a couple of guests at a time can purchase from the vendor. |
| 63043 | Purchase a fancy family restroom.  Guests will need to use restrooms if they eat or drink, or if they've been in the zoo for very long. This restroom is larger than the small restroom, but more expensive. |
| 63044 | Purchase a fancy ice cream stand.  Everyone, especially kids, loves ice cream. Eating it won't relieve much guest hunger, but the building is a lot prettier than a pizza shack. |
| 63045 | Purchase a fancy pizza stand.  Pizza is more filling than hamburgers or hot dogs, and due to pizza's circular shape, more people will be able to buy pizza at a time. |
