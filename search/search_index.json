As far as modding goes, the only thing that Blue Fang (the game's original developer) gave us was the ability to read and edit the configuration files, and that's it. Although editing configuration files is powerful, it's not enough to make the game do everything we want it to do. This is where scripting comes in because we can puppeteer the game's behavior to our liking.</p>"},{"location":"zt1/advanced/lua-scripting-in-zt1/#programming-languages","title":"Programming Languages","text":"<p>There are many programing languages out there. They are languages in the sense that we as programmmers use them to communicate with the computer. However, it's not a conversation like we can have with each other. Instead, we have to be very specific and precise with our instructions. Following a recipe is a good analogy for programming because like in cooking, if you miss a step, the computer will not understand what you want it to do and the end result isn't so tasty. I mean, functional. Unless we're talking artificial intelligence, but that's a whole other can of worms we won't get into.</p> <p>In fact, Zoo Tycoon 1 and EMU API were written in a popular programmming called C++. C++ is a powerful language, but it can also be very complex and difficult to learn. Lua on the other hand is much simpler and easier to learn, and it's also very fast. It's great for modding enthusiasts because though it's still programming, a lot has been abstracted away behind the scenes to make it easier to work with.</p> <p>Here is an example of a simple C++ program that prints \"Hello, World!\" to the console:</p> <pre><code>#include &lt;iostream&gt;\n\nint main() {\n    std::cout &lt;&lt; \"Hello, World!\" &lt;&lt; std::endl;\n    return 0;\n}\n</code></pre> <p>And here is the same program written in Lua:</p> <pre><code>print(\"Hello, World!\")\n</code></pre> <p>As you can see, the Lua program is much simpler and easier to understand, so it makes it a great choice for scripting in games. </p> <p>I sort of touched on this just now, but what EMU API does is it does something called abstraction. This means it takes the complex C++ code and packages it up in a way that users can interact with it using Lua. This is a very powerful concept and it's what makes Lua scripting in Zoo Tycoon 1 possible.</p> <p>When we use Lua scripts in Zoo Tycoon 1, we are essentially calling the complicated C++ code that has been hidden away from us. This is why we need EMU API to use Lua in Zoo Tycoon 1.

The <code>getSelectedEntity</code> function returns the entity that is currently selected in the game, or <code>Null</code> if nothing is selected. We then store this result in a variable called <code>entity</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>The next line checks if the entity is not <code>Null</code>.

It returns <code>true</code> if the entity is <code>Null</code>, and <code>false</code> if it is not.</p> </li> <li> <p>We then create a <code>ZTGuest</code> object from the <code>entity</code> variable. This is a custom object that EMU API provides for us to interact with guests in the game. We then store this result in a variable called <code>guest</code>.</p> <pre><code>local guest = ZTGuest.new(entity)\n</code></pre> <p>Once we have a guest object, we can start operating on it with functions that EMU API provides.

Generally speaking, any functions that operate on an entity type function can be mapped to the configuration most Zoo Tycoon 1 modders are familiar with. When we change <code>cSelectable</code> to <code>1</code>, we are changing the <code>cSelectable</code> property of the entity type.</p> <p>Note however that entity types are built on several levels of inheritance, and the entity type's behavior is determined by the properties of its parent entity types. For example, all functions available to the core entity type <code>BFEntityType</code> are also available to all of its children objects and their children, but not the other way around. This means that if you want to operate on a specific entity type, you need to make sure that the function you are calling is available to that entity type or else it will not work and may cause undefined behavior.</p> <p>To make sense of this reference section, please refer to the following graph of inheritence as you read through the documentation:</p> Credit: Finn from the OpenZT project"},{"location":"zt1/reference/emu/api/entitytypes/#example-usage","title":"Example Usage","text":"<p>This API relies on the programmer to obtain an entity type object from the game's memory in order to make use of any of the following functions.

This will replace the alpha channel with the secondary color in your GIMP color palette. However, this isn't always perfect because intermediate alpha values might not look good once replaced.

You can go about this by going layer by layer and removing the alpha channel as we did above. That will work but is a bit tedious. Alternatively, you can use the Multi-Layers Merger script to give each layer a solid color background in one go. Note that this assumes that the only transparent pixels in your image is the background. If you have alpha artifacts in your image, you'll need to remove them manually. Make sure you've done this before moving on. As mentioned previously, you can automate this using the Blender compositing node editor.</p> </li> <li> <p>First, create a new layer and fill it with the color you want to use as the background.
