# OpenZT Modding

!!! warning WIP
    OpenZT is a work in progress, every effort is being made to minimize changes to how modding works

OpenZT modding extends and simplifies the capabilities of vanilla Zoo Tycoon modding with an end goal of being able to mod all aspects of Zoo Tycoon and add custom scripts. 

## Zoo Tycoon Limitations
If you are an experienced Zoo Tycoon modder you will be familiar with the limitations on certain aspects of modding. Where possible OpenZT mods are designed without these limitations.

### DLL Strings
DLL strings are not required or supported in OpenZT mods


### Directory names length and clashes
All directory paths are unique to your mod, you don't need to worry about clashes

## New Types of Mods

- [Habitats and Locations](./habitats_and_locations.md)

## Future Plans

 - Animal recolours (alternate .pal files)
 - Patches (small edits to vanilla or modded animals, buildings etc)
 - Custom scenarios
 - Custom maps
 - Scripting
