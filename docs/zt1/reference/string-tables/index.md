# String Table References

String tables are a way to store strings in a single location and reference them from multiple places. Zoo Tycoon 1 uses resource files to store these strings compiled as `.dll` files. The game uses these strings to display text in the user interface, such as the main menu, in-game menus, and notifications. The game often uses the IDs associated with these strings to reference them in the game's code for other things like error messages, notifications, entity operations, and more.

Official string tables are stored in the main Zoo Tycoon 1 install directory at `C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Games\Zoo Tycoon`.

Unofficial string tables can be downloaded from modding websites usually as a requirement for a mod that needs custom strings. Once downloaded, they are installed in the same directory as above.
